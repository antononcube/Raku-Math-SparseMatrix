Revision history for "Math::SparseMatrix"

0.0.13 2026-01-16
    - Conversion to dense matrix method: .dense-matrix().
    - Allowing ":edges" to be used as a synonym of ":edge-dataset" in .new().

0.0.12 2025-11-22
    - Diagonal matrices can be created by specifying the diagonal index.
        - The diagonal offset is an integer.

0.0.11 2025-11-02
    - Better attribute name: using "adjacency-map" instead of "adjacency-list" for Math::SparseMatrix::DOK class.
    - Better basic examples notebook.

0.0.10 2025-11-01
    - Implemented dedicated diagonal matrix creation with .new(:diagonal => @a, |).

0.0.9 2025-10-21
    - Performance improvements.
        - Small ones: faster row/column names processing during creation and transposing.

0.0.8 2025-10-20
    - Dedicated row- and columns sums for CSR and DOK matrices.
    - Implemented CSR top-K elements matrix making.
    - Performance improvements.

0.0.7 2025-10-12
    - Bug fix -- correct handling of row-slices with all digit string row-names.
    - Added references to "JavaScript::D3" in the README.

0.0.6 2025-10-12
    - Correct redirection to elementwise multiplication algorithms when implicit values are non-zero.
    - Added missing delegation to .adjacency-lists()aa.

0.0.5 2025-10-11
    - "Small" fixes; faster row-suns.

0.0.4 2025-10-10
    - Enhanced creation with rules and dense matrices to take row- and column names.
    - Implemented imposing of row- and column names.
    - Implemented row- and column sums and maxes.
        - Implicit values are taken into account.
        - Hashmaps with row- and column names can be obtained with the adverb :pairs.
    - Implemented the method apply-elementwise(&func) for all three classes.
        - Delegation to apply-elementwise(), clip(), and unitize() to the core-matrix.
    - Dependency increment for "Math::SparseMatrix::Native".
